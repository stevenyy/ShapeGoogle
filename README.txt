It seems that D2 and spin image perform better. Shell histogram with sorted sectors and A3 also do well.
This is because these descriptors are all rotation invariant, which enables them to identify similar shapes as in the same group. For example a spin image is generated by rotating about the primary PCA axis, so rotation is effectively factored out. Same for sorted sectors: since they are sorted, rotation won't change the number of points in each bin. As for D2 and A3, since points are randomly sampled, rotation doesn't affact them at all. They are all discerning as well, for spin image and sorted sectors are essentially 2d histograms which retain more information about the original shapes. D2 and A3 are discerning again due to the randomness of sampling: changes in the shape would be reflected in the randomly sampled distances/angles.
